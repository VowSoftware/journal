# Journal

This repository serves as my technical journal. I write about my daily experiences as a software developer, make progress updates on my own projects, discuss topics I see floating around the Internet, reflect on past successes and failures, and instill new knowledge that I gain while making cool stuff.

Entries are titled using the *YYYY_MM_DD_T* format, where *T* separates unrelated topics into their own files if written on the same day. One of the great advantages of text-based writeups is the ability to go back and change them if needed. I don't plan on doing this often since it goes against the nature of a journal, however I won't be deceptive about it whenever it does happen.

I'm always happy to answer questions or chat about anything posted here. If you'd like to comment on a journal entry, please use GitHub's [Discussions](https://github.com/VowSoftware/journal/discussions) feature. Remember to link to the relevant entry somewhere in your post.
