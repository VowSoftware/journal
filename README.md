# Journal

This repository serves as my technical journal. I write about my daily experiences as a software developer, make progress updates on my own projects, discuss topics I see floating around the Internet, reflect on past successes and failures, and instill new knowledge that I gain while making cool stuff.

I'm always happy to answer questions or chat about anything posted here. If you'd like to comment on a journal entry, please use GitHub's [Discussions](https://github.com/VowSoftware/journal/discussions) feature. Remember to link to the relevant entry somewhere in your post.

Please click the ☆ button on GitHub if this repository is useful. Thank you!
